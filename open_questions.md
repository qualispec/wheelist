rSpec testing - ask Ned how to avoid using instance @ variables?

resources :sessions - should make singular?

user model - validate e-mail format

_image.html.erb partial - forgot how this worked. Automatically iterates over each element?

sessions_helper - figure out redirect_back_or

Cartagging and Wheeltagging are not saving user_id upon form input. This is expected,
	need to add it.

Filtering is not working right now, because I am submitting a form on an index page,
which redirects to /new or something. Might need to use javascript for filtering.

How to deal with POSTing to images/index when by default index is GET only and POST action goes to Create?


Sending GET parameters via the URL query string to Index action?
