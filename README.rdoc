Wheelistic/Pitcrew is a photo-sharing community aimed at car enthusiasts (such as myself) who enjoy personalizing their cars for show or sport. The site allows you to link images and tag them with attributes of the car (such as model and color) as well as the attributes of the aftermarket accessories that the enthusiast has installed on the car. Attaching these tags as structured data to each photo solves the problem of not being able to find good examples of what an aftermarket part might look like on a car similar to your own, which affects the enthusiast's ability to make an informed purchasing decision. Currently, this information is buried in forum posts in various car community sites online that are hard to search for and surface. My site makes it very easy to filter for the particular photo that you are looking for to give you an idea of what a part would look like on your car, so that you can decide if you want to buy that part or find an alternative that you like. My plan is to launch the site initially with a focus on aftermarket wheels because wheels are a high dollar accessory, have a multitude of options available, and make a significant impact on the visual appearance and performance of a car.

The web app is built using Ruby on Rails, with extensive use of Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX on the front-end for a seamless user experience that allows dynamic filtering of images and adding/updating of tags/comments without page redirects.

A deployed (but work in progress!) version of the site can be found at:
